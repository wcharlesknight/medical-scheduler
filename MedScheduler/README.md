Medical Scheduler Application
Getting Started
-To begin make sure you have the latest version of Rails installed. This application was built on Rails 6.0.3.4.

-Once the application has loaded type "bundle install" into the console to ensure you have what is needed to run the application. Afterwards, type "rails s" in the console to start Rails and go to our homepage at: "http://localhost:3000/patients"

-We tried to make this application as intuitive as posisble. You can access anything on the application from our homepage. At the top of the page there are links to create a new appointment or check analytics of the medical group.

-Further down the page we have listed links to all of the hospitals, pharmacies, and specialties that we provide.

-By clicking the "Create New Apppointment" link on the homepage, you will be taken to our new appointment page. From here you can create an appointment from the dropdown list of physicians and patients and describe symptoms.

-If your physician already has an appointment for that time slot you will be notified and asked to choose a different time. After scheduling your appointment you will be redirected to your physicians show page where you can see their specialty, pharmacy, and hospital where they provide care. You can also see their average cost and rating as well as leave a rating of your own after your visit.

-If you're unsure which doctor to schedule an appointment with, the analytics link on the homepage may help. On the analytics page you will find the highest rated physicians, most expensive specialty, and busiest / slowest pharmacies and hospitals to receive care at.
